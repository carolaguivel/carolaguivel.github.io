<p class="question"><a href="11.html">The deontological ethicist would keep their original promise of giving the gold to the son because the 
deontological ethicist believes that it is their moral 
duty to fulfill the promise regardless of the future 
consequences (the fulfillment of the self-imposed duty 
is the consequence itself). The deontologist does not 
define what a moral is, nor an ethic, nor can the 
deontologist explain what is implied by moral duty, but 
still the deontologist view will claim to have<br>behaved 
morally.
