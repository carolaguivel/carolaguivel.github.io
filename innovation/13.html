<p class="question">You are a quite competent swimmer and you are out for a leisurely stroll. During the course of your walk you pass by a deserted pier from which a teenage boy who apparently cannot swim has fallen into the water. The boy is screaming for help. You recognize that there is absolutely no danger to yourself if you jump in to save the boy. Nevertheless, you don't want to get your clothes wet and the water is cold, so you are afraid of catching a cold. Do you have a moral obligation to save this boy?
<br>
<br>
<a href="14.html" class="answer">Yes, that's why you jump into the pier and try to<br>save him.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="14.html" class="answer">No, that's why you ignore the boy's screams and<br>pass on.</a>
