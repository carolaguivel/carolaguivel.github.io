<p class="question">There is a runaway trolley barrelling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people 
tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed 
straight for them. You are standing some distance off 
in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this 
lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of 
tracks. However, you notice that there is one person 
tied up on the side track. You have two options:
<br>
<br>
<a href="6.html" class="answer">Do not get involved, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="6.html" class="answer">Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.</a>
<br>
