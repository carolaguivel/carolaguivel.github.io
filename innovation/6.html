<p class="question"><a href="7.html">Utilitarianism, which holds that an action is right if it leads to the most happiness for the greatest number 
of people (“happiness” here is defined as the 
maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain). 
The origins of Utilitarianism can be traced back as far 
as the Greek philosopher Epicurus, but its full 
formulation is usually credited to Jeremy Betham, with 
John Stuart Mill as its foremost proponent.
