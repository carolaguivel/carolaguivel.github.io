<p class="question"><a href="11.html">The consequentialist would give the gold to the hospital because he would conclude (create an excuse) 
that the consequences of giving the gold to the son 
would be a waste and a danger to humanity, while the 
consequence of giving the gold to the hospital would 
profit humanity in general. The intermediate act (of 
giving the gold to the hospital) that is incorrectly 
believed to be the final act is the one that determines 
the existence of consequentialist ethics.
