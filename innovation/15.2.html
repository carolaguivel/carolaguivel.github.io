<p class="question">A madman who has threatened to explode several bombs in crowded areas has been apprehended. Unfortunately, he has already planted the bombs and they are scheduled to go off in a short time. It is possible that thousands of people may die. The authorities cannot make him divulge the location of the bombs by conventional methods. In exasperation, some high level official suggests torture. This would be illegal, of course, but the official thinks that it is nevertheless the right thing to do in this desperate situation. Do you agree?

<br>
<a href="16.3.html" class="answer">Yes, in order to save the lives of thousands of people he should be tortured.</a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="16.4.html" class="answer">No, torture is always wrong.</a>
