<p class="question"><a href="9.html">Consequentialism argues that the morality of an action is contingent on the action’s outcome or result. Thus, 
a morally right action is one that produces a good 
outcome or consequence. Consequentialist theories must 
consider questions like “What sort of consequences 
count as good consequences?”, “Who is the primary 
beneficiary of moral action?”, “How are the 
consequences judged and who judges them?”
