Some completed a handful of orbits; others - thousands. But to date, those that have had the privilege of seeing our planet from above its atmosphere number not much more than 500.<br/><br/>This is about to change. Companies offering ordinary citizens the possibility to fly to above the Kármán line 100km above the surface of the Earth - accepted to be the beginning of space - have emerged in America and will soon do so elsewhere.",

                    "text2" : "As the number of flights increases and lessons in operations and reusability are learned and applied, launch costs and ticket prices will come down. That will in turn escalate demand, which will increase flight rates, further reducing costs, once again driving down prices and ultimately leading to a virtuous cycle. We are soon to witness the first steps of the evolution of commercial space transportation not online that which occurred in commercial aviation in the late 1920’s. What was once the domain of only those with the “right stuff” will be accessible to millions. Access to space is being democratized.<br/><br/>While the technical and financial hurdles to get to orbit remain significantly more challenging than hose facing suborbital spacecraft developers, they too are being overcome by private enterprises. Several companies are vying to achieve what has only been accomplished heretofore by a handful of governments - sending humans to low Earth orbit. At first, their destination will be the massive and magnificent International Space Station, and their customers will be government astronauts of the five partner space agencies involved in that project. But other firms conceiving orbital destinations for research customers, by the companies or countries, and will later develop habitats for other users. With transportation and destinations in development today, the establishment of a marketplace in low Earth orbit is around the corner.<br/><br/>The sensations - both physiological and psychological that many more will experience than ever before are not to be taken lightly. Massive amounts of energy will be transformed from solid, liquid or hybrid rocket propellant to thunderous accelerations that will hurtle the spaceflight participant into the heavens with ferocity and ceaselessness that are as difficult to imagine as they are unbelievably exhilarating. The thrill I experienced during my launches - one each on Space Shuttles Columbia, Discovery, and Endeavour, and Soyuz TMA-9 - seemed only to increase with each episode. I seemed able to more acutely perceive nuances amid the unrelenting acceleration and the sheer violence of the staging events.",

My MIT thesis was titled “Guidance for Manned Orbital Rendezvous,” dedicating that research work to the American astronauts. To write that lengthy treatment of the topic, I drew upon my experience as a fighter pilot and the skills needed to intercept enemy aircraft. From that expertise I developed a technique for two piloted spacecraft to rendezvous in space.",

                    "text2" : "I was not a test pilot. But with dogged determination to seek a career as an astronaut, I applied again. This time, my jet fighter experience and NASA’s growing interesting in mastering space rendezvous influenced them to accept me into the third group of astronauts in October 1963. I was the first astronaut selected with a doctorate and became known to my fellow astronauts as 'Dr. Rendezvous.'<br/><br/>I am proud to say that my rendezvous and docking ideas were vital to the success of the Gemini and Apollo programs, and they are still used today. My early astronaut years allowed me also to pioneer underwater training techniques, as a substitute for zero gravity flights, to simulate spacewalking. My first space journey was in 1966, as pilot of Gemini 12, with James Lovell as command pilot of the mission. That nearly four-day flight brought to a successful close the stepping stone Gemini program of ten piloted missions. During that flight I was able to establish a new record for spacewalking, spending five and a half hours outside the two-seater Gemini.<br><br/>But when Gemini 12 splashed down, the unmistakable realization was that we had but a handful of years remaining to achieve Kennedy’s challenge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. There was much work ahead of us. It was inspirational watching a team of 400,000 people working together on a common dream. It was a unified enterprise, a synergy of innovation, effort, and teamwork that was unstoppable - all necessary ingredients to make real a long-held dream of humankind leaning forward to the Moon.<br/><br/>Those early pioneering years were instrumental in shaping my passion today: to help forge our future trajectory in space. Those early pioneering years were instrumental in shaping my passion today: to help forge our future trajectory in space. That zeal is guided by two principles: a continuously expanding human presence in space; and promoting U.S. global leadership in space by being a 'global team player.' That means working with other countries so all can reap the countless benefits that stem from space exploration.<br>When Neil and I stepped off our Eagle lander’s ladder onto the stark terrain of the Moon’s Sea of Tranquility, it was just eight years after U.S. President John F. Kennedy committed America to strive for the impossible. I’m often asked:",
                    "quote2" : "Did I feel alone standing on the Moon? Not really.",
                    "text3" : "There were nearly a billion people all over the Earth who watched and listened as we moonwalked across that magnificent desolation. With Mike Collins circling the Moon in the Columbia command module, we became elite members of the Lonely Hearts Club - we were farther away than any three humans had ever been. Still, we felt connected to home.<br/><br/>During my hours on the lunar surface, I did gaze back at Earth. In that solitude, I saw our world as it sat suspended, surrounded by the darkness of space. That blackness is so deep that I could almost reach out and touch it. But then you see planet Earth. It is a soft, glowing presence, bulging from the abyss. It has vividness, aliveness that is not captured in photographs. All of humanity and those I knew and loved resided on that blue sphere.<br/><br/>My stay on the Moon in 1969 filled me with countless other recollections. By the way, while Neil was the first to step on the Moon, I’m the first alien from another world to enter a spacecraft that was going to Earth!<br/><br/>But fast forward into the Twenty-First Century and those reminiscences, as dear to me as they are, fall victim to the saying: 'That was then, this is now.'<br/></br>Today, I see the Moon in a far different light. Firstly, America should not re-engage in a second “Moon Race.” That constitutes a dead end, a waste of precious resources. The united States won that contest more than two decades (four and a half decades) ago. What is needed is to lay out what the U.S. involvement at the Moon should be - a plan that refrains from competing but assists every other nation that is planning to land on the lunar surface. That improved plan is to be cooperative with international partners who also want to reach the Moon. In sum, we can afford to be magnanimous. Yes, the United States got there first… but now is the to make it a first step for others.<br/><br/>My vision for the Moon is for both a nearside and far side Lunar Operations Complex. The establishment of this infrastructure would not only tap the resources rich Moon by commercial, private sector groups, but also stimulate international partnerships between nations. America can lead the way in robotic hab/lab building on the Moon by fostering a presence at the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 points, libration gate ports that permit robotic assembly - piece by piece - of hardware and habitation on the Moon. Furthermore, how best to accomplish this on the Moon can be hammered out earlier at a Hawaii-based International Lunar Research Park - essentially trial-running assembly tasks that would be done on the Moon. The high-technology job for the U.S. is developing a Universal Interconnecting device, equipment that enables the coupling of modules and other gear from multiple nations.<br/><br/>In short, America’s return to the Moon is one that is robotic, to offer infrastructure and leadership. It is one that embraces the talents of China, India, Russia, Japan, Europe, and others, to establish a solid - and this time permanent - foothold on the Moon. Furthermore, in doing so, the U.S. and other nations can sharpen their respective technological skill sets, the know-how that’s mandatory for eventual homesteading of Mars.<br/><br/>Future space travelers will include men and women from all walks of life, taking advantage of trips aboard commercial spaceships. Expectations are high to create a money-making, booming market for tourist-carrying space liners. Initially, vehicles will fly “suborbital” trajectories; then commercial rocket ships will be dedicated to speed tourists into Earth’s orbit. While such voyages are history - making affairs, there’s no leap of faith required. The evolution of flight from the Wright Brothers to today underscores the taming of speed and altitude.<br/><br/>Indeed, it wasn’t until the twentieth century that man took that first powered flight. In 1903, on a windy morning at Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, the Wright Brothers’ Flyer took their maiden voyage, defying gravity. Incidentally, my mother, Marion Moon, was born that same year. And only sixty six years later, Neil and I stepped on the Moon, fulfilling the dreams of million.<br/><br/>The word 'tourism' may sound tame. But travel and tourism now form the world’s largest industry, with a gross annual output of several trillion dollars a year. Space tourism is the logical destination for that market. What’s more, at this very instant, over 300,000 people are off the Earth. That is, they are in the air and safely seated within aircraft zooming from one destination to another. Anchored in the history of aviation and the advancements ahead, public space travel is in the offing, a progression of technology… and economics. Yes, that means going a little higher, and gaining a bit more speed. Are there technical challenges ahead in creating the space transportation systems to support space tourism? Yes. In my view, the future resides in reaching orbit less expensively via the development of reusable, two-stage systems capable of airline-type operations. These systems will have high reliability, very quick turn-around, and a large passenger capacity. Years ago I formed ShareSpace for several reasons: to support public interest in space travel and to educate people of all ages and comes about the possibility - the very real possibility - that they themselves might live this dream. I call them “Global Space Travelers,” those that will experience the wonder of space first-hand, while increasing our knowledge of how common people - without years of astronaut training - take to the environment of space. At the same time, it will ignite the market for commercial space vehicles. This enthusiasm, on the part of industry and the public, will inspire the government to set up sensible, forward-looking regulations. The space tourism industry will begin. A growing number of citizen space explorers would put backbone into the expression: “If the people lead, the leaders will follow.” It’s not difficult for me to envision various types of vehicles dedicated to space tourism, built by aerospace firms, operated by private firms, and perhaps booked through companies like Wilderness Travel and Club Med! Space tourism gives new meaning to “you are free to move about the cabin.” By far the most exhilarating aspect of space travel is the ability to feel your body being liberated from a two-dimensional existence to a 3D existence. Secondly, having face time with Earth is a bonding experience, to get a unique view of our planet. That perspective has been dubbed the “Overview Effect.” Getting an eyeful of Earth from space can affect a person’s attitude about themselves, their planet of origin, and their own place in space and time. By lessening the expense of attaining Earth orbit, many new industries are waiting to develop, one of which will be space tourism. Within time, cis-lunar and interplanetary cruise ships will evolve. The upshot is that tens of thousands of citizens will have the opportunity to travel into space, gaining a sense of “participation” in opening the frontier of space to enterprise, exploration, and settlement.",

                    "text4" : "There is a pressing need to get the world excited once again about space exploration and to harness the pioneering spirit to reach beyond our boundaries and current capabilities. After all, what’s a future for? To reach beyond low Earth orbit requires a progressive suite of missions that are the vital underpinnings - a foundation - for what I call a Unified Space Vision (USV). It’s a blueprint that will maintain U.S. leadership in human spaceflight, but avoids a counterproductive space race with China to be second back to the Moon, and leads to a permanent American-led human presence on Mars by 2010 (2040). But plotting out, putting in place, and staying on track with a unified approach to space program activities must begin now. There are no “giant leaps” this time. More like a hop, skip and a jump strategy. Step by step - just as Mercury and Gemini made Apollo possible - we move deeper into space to land on Phobos, the inner Moon of Mars, all in prelude to sojourns on the Red Planet itself. A Phobos base would be the ideal perch from which to monitor and control the robots that will build the infrastructure on the Martian surface, in preparation for the first human visitors. The techniques and technologies for doing so will be honed at the Moon. Such bold missions of exploration will require determination, support and political will, as did our mission to the Moon over four-and-a-half decades ago. If we have the vision, we can reach a diversity of destinations, including asteroids, on the pathway to Mars. My USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) calls for essential basics, such as an Exploration Module imbued with radiation shielding, food-production, and recycling facilities needed for spaceflight of up to three years. The International Space Station, (which was completed in 1981), is the ideal test bed for showcasing these capabilities, as well as for evaluating rigid and inflatable structures useful for the outward movement of crew into deep space. We must use our station savvy to prototype specialized safe-haven, interplanetary, and taxi modules, hardware that can be combined with NASA Orion-type crew vehicles. By way of reusable spacecraft that I call “Cyclers” traffic routes between Earth and the Moon, Mars and Earth can be put in motion. Very much like ocean liners, the Cycler system would perpetually glide along predictable pathways, moving people, equipment, and other materials to and from the Earth over inner-Solar System mileage. Looking towards 2046, the Earth, the Moon, and Mars will form a celestial triad of worlds - busy hubs for the ebb and flow of passengers, cargo and commerce traversing the inner-Solar System. The common, sustainable like that ties humanity’s space future together is reusability - a progressive set of reusable boosters, reusable access to space, and reusable interplanetary cyclers. Humankind is at an inflection moment in history, a chance to test the next generation of space adventures to reach out into deep space and start moving along the pathway to homesteading the Red Planet and becoming a multi-planet species. The challenge ahead is not only daunting, it is monumental and historic. And it’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.",
