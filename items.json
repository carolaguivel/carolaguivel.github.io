In its final days, the hot, bright ball of gas at the center of our planetary system will grow and grow so much that first tiny Mercury, then Venus - our sister planet, already heated to an unbearable 500 degrees Celsius by a tremendous greenhouse effect - will vanish into the fiery, swirling outermost layers of gas.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>This does not bode well for Earth, which by then will be following a tight orbit above the glowing hot plasma of the corona surrounding the Sun. Its oceans will begin to boil and all water will evaporate. The polar ice caps will have long been gone by this point. And as for life, it will no longer be possible on this once beautiful planet, celebrated in Carl Sagan’s wonderful book Pale Blue Dot.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>So we have to leave this planet, whatever the cost - and sooner rather than later.

Basically, in the last 400 years, we have managed to take stock of our pale in the Universe: first by using more and more powerful telescopes, then, for slightly more than half a century, by sending small  robotic probes out into space. First to the Moon, then to our neighbours Venus and Mars, and finally to the furthest reaches of the Solar System - a planetary system based on the universal law of gravitation (universal in the truest sense of the word) and that a certain Sir Isaac Newton summarized in a mathematical formula some time ago.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Newton’s law simply states, firstly, that all matter exerts a mutual force on all other matter and, secondly, that a large mass has a greater attractive force than a small one. This is why the planets orbit the Sun - where almost all of mass is now concentrated in this bubble of material formed from billion years ago - and it is also why Moons in turn orbit planets. The fact that they do not fall into the Sun, despite the attractive force of its two quadrilliard ton mass, is the result of the angular momentum these small worlds of rock, ice and gas acquired when they formed in the gigantic disc of dust and gas rotating around the young Sun.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Starting from the Sun, there are five spheres of rock and ice (we are making an exception by including the Moon in this planetary family because it is a permanent and similarly formed companion of Earth). Next is a terrifying, apparently random section full of rocky debris - the asteroids, a rather chaotic zone partially brought under control by the nearest and most massive planet, Jupiter. We earthly beings, who are today thinking about the next place to call home, have this giant of gas with (presumably) some rock and ice in its interior to that for our existence. Its gravity ensures that the “sky only rarely falls on our heads” and that a bullseye by one of these boulders, which can be up to several hundred kilometers wide, does not bring about our doomsday (which is what the Gauls were terrified of 2000 years ago! And not without reason, as the thousands of circular craters on the Moon and many a hole down here are solid proof that asteroids struck Earth. Just ask T.Rex’s family!).

If anywhere, that is where life would exist, or would have existed. Only very simple life, but at least everything required for life is there - water, volcanic heat, mineral nutrients. Researchers are still scratching their heads about this.

Uranus (the primordial ruler of the sky who, for whatever reason, hated his numerous descendants so much that he hid them in the Underworld before Gaia, the Earth Mother, decided to have him castrated with a sickle). And finally Neptune (god of flowing water and the seas - a rather kind old man who at least sported a trident).</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>These three planets most certainly are not a haven for life either. Neither are their Moons, even though the largest of them, Titan, like Earth, has a thick but cold atmosphere, somehow similar to Earth’s.

In an interview, Dr. Logsdon said it has to be “a singular act that would force action, that you couldn’t ignore.” Other moon shot prerequisites, he said, include leaders in a position to direct the resources necessary to meet the goal on “a warlike basis,” with very deep national pockets — people like President Kennedy, who began the program, and Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, who brought it to fruition.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Finally, Dr. Logsdon said, “the objective has to be technically feasible.” Scientists and engineers had told Mr. Kennedy that “there were no technical show stoppers in sending humans to the moon — it would just take a hell of a lot of engineering.” What would be the “action-forcing stimulus” for a climate moon shot, he asked?

Only four of the original 18 suits are still rated for spaceflight, and all of those are on the space station.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>NASA first planned to have extra-small, small, medium, large and extra-large suits. For budget reasons, the extra-small, small and extra-large suits were cut. However, many of the male astronauts could not fit into the large suits, so the bigger size was brought back. The smaller sizes never were.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Cady Coleman, an astronaut who has flown on two space shuttles and traveled to the space station, stands 5 feet 4 inches tall and remains the smallest person to ever qualify for a spacewalk. While she was training in NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab, she had to improvise padding to wear inside her spacesuit.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Without that, smaller people would have an air bubble inside their suits that would make them spin in the lab’s pool as if a beach ball were strapped to their stomachs. It would not be a problem in space, Ms. Coleman told me. “But the N.B.L. was where people decided if you had what it takes to do a spacewalk,” she said.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>And complaints? Well, no one else previously had that problem, so it must just be the person who complained. As a result, this gender bias became a mistake that we did not learn from, because the female astronauts compensated.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Inside the spacesuits, astronauts wear the liquid cooling and ventilation garment. This looks like long underwear covered with meters of tubes. It pumps water around the astronauts to cool them. Men and women wear the same style of garment despite the fact that we have different sweat patterns. Men sweat more than comparably fit women, and the areas where they sweat the most occur in different parts of the body. In other words, when it comes to temperature-controlling garments, the needs are different for men and women.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>We are already aware of this in relation to office temperatures. Temperatures are set for men, which leaves women carrying sweaters to work.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>A 2015 study by Dutch researchers found that indoor climate regulations were based on “an empirical thermal comfort model” developed in the 1960s. “Standard values for one of its primary variables — metabolic rate — are based on an average male, and may overestimate female metabolic rate by up to 35 percent,” they concluded.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>NASA took pride in advertising the space shuttle as being a shirt-sleeve environment. And yet, if you watch “The Dream Is Alive,” a 1985 documentary made by crews aboard the shuttles, take note of the thick wool slippers on Kathryn Sullivan’s feet.</p>",

                    "text3" : "<p>It is worth looking back to the 1950s, when it seemed that women might be included in the early space program. In the 1950s, before we had put anyone into space at all, Dr. Randolph Lovelace wondered how women would fare as space travelers. He had designed the tests for the Mercury astronauts and proceeded to put 19 women through the first round of assessments. Thirteen passed. In fact, from testing the “First Lady Astronaut Trainees,” Dr. Lovelace discovered that women might be better suited to space than men.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>They were smaller, which would reduce the weight of payloads. They had better cardiovascular health and lower oxygen consumption. And they tolerated higher G-forces and outperformed men on isolation and stress tests. (One of the women was a mother of eight, and I imagine her looking at the tests and wondering when things would get difficult.)</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Despite all this, the tests were stopped. The women, later known as the Mercury 13, went to Congress to try to fight the ruling, but by then, the United States was in a moon race. Putting a woman into space was seen as a distraction, in part because the Soviet Union had already sent the first woman into space, Valentina Tereshkova, and that was derided as being just a publicity stunt.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>This decision meant that by 1962 it was confirmed policy, as one NASA official wrote in a letter to a young girl who was interested in becoming an astronaut, that:</p>",

During project Mercury, astronauts did not need scientific training - they simply needed a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. John Glenn did not even have a degree.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>And the flight training - what did this mean, exactly? For project Mercury, astronauts needed to be a graduate of test pilot school, with a minimum of 1,500 hours flying time, and a qualified jet pilot. The requirement to be a test pilot was a logical choice, not so much because of the nerves of steel required to fly experimental aircraft, but because test pilots are trained to take notes while piloting and to deliver clear reports afterward. But this criterion eliminated female pilots, because the only qualified test pilot schools were military and they did not accept women.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Mind you, during World War II, the Women Airforce Service Pilots were responsible for training pilots and towing planes for live-ammunition practice, as well as for ferrying and testing aircraft. In many cases, these women logged more flight hours than their male counterparts. They did not, however, have a certificate from a test pilot school.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Kari Love, a former spacesuit designer, once told me that “while we can look back and understand why women were an afterthought in aerospace to this point, we are at serious risk for that to be reproduced as we move into the commercial spaceflight era.”</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Without conscious thought, the design of the ship and the lunar platform for the Artemis missions is likely to reproduce design choices made in the Apollo era when astronauts were all men. Ladder rungs are set at the optimum distance for the average man. The pistol-grip tool, or cordless drill, is sized for a man’s hand.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Then there are the questions that we cannot answer simply because we have too little data. Since 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, over 500 people have been in space and only 64 of them have been women. We know that astronauts receive more radiation in space. Studies on Earth show that radiation can affect women at a rate 10 times higher than men. How will that play out in space?</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>As we look back at the Apollo mission and forward to Artemis, it is important to examine the gender biases of the early space program for lessons learned. If we want to land the first woman on the moon, let’s make sure she has tools designed with her in mind. Eliminating the legacy of gender bias is just one small step.</p>",

My early astronaut years allowed me also to pioneer underwater training techniques, as a substitute for zero gravity flights, to simulate spacewalking. My first space journey was in 1966, as pilot of Gemini 12, with James Lovell as command pilot of the mission. That nearly four-day flight brought to a successful close the stepping stone Gemini program of ten piloted missions. During that flight I was able to establish a new record for spacewalking, spending five and a half hours outside the two-seater Gemini.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But when Gemini 12 splashed down, the unmistakable realization was that we had but a handful of years remaining to achieve Kennedy’s challenge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade.

IN that solitude, I saw our world as it sat suspended, surrounded by the darkness of space. That blackness is so deep that I could almost reach out and touch it. But then you see planet Earth. It is a soft, glowing presence, bulging from the abyss. It has vividness, aliveness that is not captured in photographs. All of humanity and those I knew and loved resided on that blue sphere.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My stay on the Moon in 1969 filled me with countless other recollections. By the way, while Neil was the first to step on the Moon, I’m the first alien from another world to enter a spacecraft that was going to Earth!</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But fast forward into the Twenty-First Century and those reminiscences, as dear to me as they are, fall victim to the saying: “That was then, this is now.” Today, I see the Moon in a far different light.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Firstly, America should not re-engage in a second “Moon Race.” That constitutes a dead end, a waste of precious resources. The united States won that contest more than two decades (four and a half decades) ago. What is needed is to lay out what the U.S. involvement at the Moon should be - a plan that refrains from competing but assists every other nation that is planning to land on the lunar surface. That improved plan is to be cooperative with international partners who also want to reach the Moon. In sum, we can afford to be magnanimous. Yes, the United States got there first… but now is the to make it a first step for others.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My vision for the Moon is for both a nearside and far side Lunar Operations Complex. The establishment of this infrastructure would not only tap the resources rich Moon by commercial, private sector groups, but also stimulate international partnerships between nations. America can lead the way in robotic hab/lab building on the Moon by fostering a presence at the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 points, libration gate ports that permit robotic assembly - piece by piece - of hardware and habitation on the Moon. Furthermore, how best to accomplish this on the Moon can be hammered out earlier at a Hawaii-based International Lunar Research Park - essentially trial-running assembly tasks that would be done on the Moon. The high-technology job for the U.S. is developing a Universal Interconnecting device, equipment that enables the coupling of modules and other gear from multiple nations.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>In short, America’s return to the Moon is one that is robotic, to offer infrastructure and leadership. It is one that embraces the talents of China, India, Russia, Japan, Europe, and others, to establish a solid - and this time permanent - foothold on the Moon. Furthermore, in doing so, the U.S. and other nations can sharpen their respective technological skill sets, the know-how that’s mandatory for eventual homesteading of Mars.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Future space travelers will include men and women from all walks of life, taking advantage of trips aboard commercial spaceships. Expectations are high to create a money-making, booming market for tourist-carrying space liners. Initially, vehicles will fly “suborbital” trajectories; then commercial rocket ships will be dedicated to speed tourists into Earth’s orbit. While such voyages are history - making affairs, there’s no leap of faith required. The evolution of flight from the Wright Brothers to today underscores the taming of speed and altitude.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Indeed, it wasn’t until the twentieth century that man took that first powered flight. In 1903, on a windy morning at Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, the Wright Brothers’ Flyer took their maiden voyage, defying gravity. Incidentally, my mother, Marion Moon, was born that same year. And only sixty six years later, Neil and I stepped on the Moon, fulfilling the dreams of million.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The word “tourism” may sound tame. But travel and tourism now form the world’s largest industry, with a gross annual output of several trillion dollars a year. Space tourism is the logical destination for that market.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>What’s more, at this very instant, over 300,000 people are off the Earth. That is, they are in the air and safely seated within aircraft zooming from one destination to another. Anchored in the history of aviation and the advancements ahead, public space travel is in the offing, a progression of technology… and economics. Yes, that means going a little higher, and gaining a bit more speed.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Are there technical challenges ahead in creating the space transportation systems to support space tourism? Yes. In my view, the future resides in reaching orbit less expensively via the development of reusable, two-stage systems capable of airline-type operations. These systems will have high reliability, very quick turn-around, and a large passenger capacity.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Years ago I formed ShareSpace for several reasons: to support public interest in space travel and to educate people of all ages and comes about the possibility - the very real possibility - that they themselves might live this dream.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>I call them “Global Space Travelers,” those that will experience the wonder of space first-hand, while increasing our knowledge of how common people - without years of astronaut training - take to the environment of space. At the same time, it will ignite the market for commercial space vehicles. This enthusiasm, on the part of industry and the public, will inspire the government to set up sensible, forward-looking regulations. The space tourism industry will begin.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>A growing number of citizen space explorers would put backbone into the expression: “If the people lead, the leaders will follow.” It’s not difficult for me to envision various types of vehicles dedicated to space tourism, built by aerospace firms, operated by private firms, and perhaps booked through companies like Wilderness Travel and Club Med!</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Space tourism gives new meaning to “you are free to move about the cabin.” By far the most exhilarating aspect of space travel is the ability to feel your body being liberated from a two-dimensional existence to a 3D existence. Secondly, having face time with Earth is a bonding experience, to get a unique view of our planet. That perspective has been dubbed the “Overview Effect.” Getting an eyeful of Earth from space can affect a person’s attitude about themselves, their planet of origin, and their own place in space and time.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>By lessening the expense of attaining Earth orbit, many new industries are waiting to develop, one of which will be space tourism. Within time, cis-lunar and interplanetary cruise ships will evolve. The upshot is that tens of thousands of citizens will have the opportunity to travel into space, gaining a sense of “participation” in opening the frontier of space to enterprise, exploration, and settlement.</p>",

After all, what’s a future for?</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>To reach beyond low Earth orbit requires a progressive suite of missions that are the vital underpinnings - a foundation - for what I call a Unified Space Vision (USV). It’s a blueprint that will maintain U.S. leadership in human spaceflight, but avoids a counterproductive space race with China to be second back to the Moon, and leads to a permanent American-led human presence on Mars by 2010.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But plotting out, putting in place, and staying on track with a unified approach to space program activities must begin now. There are no “giant leaps” this time. More like a hop, skip and a jump strategy. Step by step - just as Mercury and Gemini made Apollo possible - we move deeper into space to land on Phobos, the inner Moon of Mars, all in prelude to sojourns on the Red Planet itself. A Phobos base would be the ideal perch from which to monitor and control the robots that will build the infrastructure on the Martian surface, in preparation for the first human visitors. The techniques and technologies for doing so will be honed at the Moon.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Such bold missions of exploration will require determination, support and political will, as did our mission to the Moon over four-and-a-half decades ago. If we have the vision, we can reach a diversity of destinations, including asteroids, on the pathway to Mars.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) calls for essential basics, such as an Exploration Module imbued with radiation shielding, food-production, and recycling facilities needed for spaceflight of up to three years. The International Space Station, which was completed in 1981, is the ideal test bed for showcasing these capabilities, as well as for evaluating rigid and inflatable structures useful for the outward movement of crew into deep space. We must use our station savvy to prototype specialized safe-haven, interplanetary, and taxi modules, hardware that can be combined with NASA Orion-type crew vehicles.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>By way of reusable spacecraft that I call “Cyclers” traffic routes between Earth and the Moon, Mars and Earth can be put in motion. Very much like ocean liners, the Cycler system would perpetually glide along predictable pathways, moving people, equipment, and other materials to and from the Earth over inner-Solar System mileage.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Looking towards 2046, the Earth, the Moon, and Mars will form a celestial triad of worlds - busy hubs for the ebb and flow of passengers, cargo and commerce traversing the inner-Solar System. The common, sustainable like that ties humanity’s space future together is reusability - a progressive set of reusable boosters, reusable access to space, and reusable interplanetary cyclers.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Humankind is at an inflection moment in history, a chance to test the next generation of space adventures to reach out into deep space and start moving along the pathway to homesteading the Red Planet and becoming a multi-planet species.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The challenge ahead is not only daunting, it is monumental and historic. And it’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.</p>",

It’s as though the layer of crust just below the surface had simply disappeared.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The easiest explanation is that subsurface volatiles — elements that can easily switch from a solid to a liquid or a gas — heated up as a result of the intrusion of magma below.
