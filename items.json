To write that lengthy treatment of the topic, I drew upon my experience as a fighter pilot and the skills needed to intercept enemy aircraft.

My early astronaut years allowed me also to pioneer underwater training techniques, as a substitute for zero gravity flights, to simulate spacewalking. My first space journey was in 1966, as pilot of Gemini 12, with James Lovell as command pilot of the mission. That nearly four-day flight brought to a successful close the stepping stone Gemini program of ten piloted missions. During that flight I was able to establish a new record for spacewalking, spending five and a half hours outside the two-seater Gemini.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But when Gemini 12 splashed down, the unmistakable realization was that we had but a handful of years remaining to achieve Kennedy’s challenge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. There was much work ahead of us. It was inspirational watching a team of 400,000 people working together on a common dream. It was a unified enterprise, a synergy of innovation, effort, and teamwork that was unstoppable - all necessary ingredients to make real a long-held dream of humankind leaning forward to the Moon.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Those early pioneering years were instrumental in shaping my passion today: to help forge our future trajectory in space. Those early pioneering years were instrumental in shaping my passion today: to help forge our future trajectory in space.

After all, what’s a future for? To reach beyond low Earth orbit requires a progressive suite of missions that are the vital underpinnings - a foundation - for what I call a Unified Space Vision (USV). It’s a blueprint that will maintain U.S. leadership in human spaceflight, but avoids a counterproductive space race with China to be second back to the Moon, and leads to a permanent American-led human presence on Mars by 2010 (2040). But plotting out, putting in place, and staying on track with a unified approach to space program activities must begin now. There are no “giant leaps” this time. More like a hop, skip and a jump strategy. Step by step - just as Mercury and Gemini made Apollo possible - we move deeper into space to land on Phobos, the inner Moon of Mars, all in prelude to sojourns on the Red Planet itself. A Phobos base would be the ideal perch from which to monitor and control the robots that will build the infrastructure on the Martian surface, in preparation for the first human visitors. The techniques and technologies for doing so will be honed at the Moon. Such bold missions of exploration will require determination, support and political will, as did our mission to the Moon over four-and-a-half decades ago. If we have the vision, we can reach a diversity of destinations, including asteroids, on the pathway to Mars. My USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) calls for essential basics, such as an Exploration Module imbued with radiation shielding, food-production, and recycling facilities needed for spaceflight of up to three years. The International Space Station, (which was completed in 1981), is the ideal test bed for showcasing these capabilities, as well as for evaluating rigid and inflatable structures useful for the outward movement of crew into deep space. We must use our station savvy to prototype specialized safe-haven, interplanetary, and taxi modules, hardware that can be combined with NASA Orion-type crew vehicles. By way of reusable spacecraft that I call “Cyclers” traffic routes between Earth and the Moon, Mars and Earth can be put in motion. Very much like ocean liners, the Cycler system would perpetually glide along predictable pathways, moving people, equipment, and other materials to and from the Earth over inner-Solar System mileage. Looking towards 2046, the Earth, the Moon, and Mars will form a celestial triad of worlds - busy hubs for the ebb and flow of passengers, cargo and commerce traversing the inner-Solar System. The common, sustainable like that ties humanity’s space future together is reusability - a progressive set of reusable boosters, reusable access to space, and reusable interplanetary cyclers. Humankind is at an inflection moment in history, a chance to test the next generation of space adventures to reach out into deep space and start moving along the pathway to homesteading the Red Planet and becoming a multi-planet species. The challenge ahead is not only daunting, it is monumental and historic. And it’s time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.",
