Then things will get uncomfortable! Our life-giving Sun will expand, becoming a death star as its fuel, hydrogen, is gradually used up and converted into helium. In its final days, the hot, bright ball of gas at the center of our planetary system will grow and grow so much that first tiny Mercury, then Venus - our sister planet, already heated to an unbearable 500 degrees Celsius by a tremendous greenhouse effect - will vanish into the fiery, swirling outermost layers of gas.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>This does not bode well for Earth, which by then will be following a tight orbit above the glowing hot plasma of the corona surrounding the Sun. Its oceans will begin to boil and all water will evaporate. The polar ice caps will have long been gone by this point. And as for life, it will no longer be possible on this once beautiful planet, celebrated in Carl Sagan’s wonderful book Pale Blue Dot.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>So we have to leave this planet, whatever the cost - and sooner rather than later. Or at least we need to start planning now. So says Stephen Hawking, the renowned astrophysicist from Cambridge.</p>",

Basically, in the last 400 years, we have managed to take stock of our pale in the Universe: first by using more and more powerful telescopes, then, for slightly more than half a century, by sending small  robotic probes out into space. First to the Moon, then to our neighbours Venus and Mars, and finally to the furthest reaches of the Solar System - a planetary system based on the universal law of gravitation (universal in the truest sense of the word) and that a certain Sir Isaac Newton summarized in a mathematical formula some time ago.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Newton’s law simply states, firstly, that all matter exerts a mutual force on all other matter and, secondly, that a large mass has a greater attractive force than a small one. This is why the planets orbit the Sun - where almost all of mass is now concentrated in this bubble of material formed from billion years ago - and it is also why Moons in turn orbit planets. The fact that they do not fall into the Sun, despite the attractive force of its two quadrilliard ton mass, is the result of the angular momentum these small worlds of rock, ice and gas acquired when they formed in the gigantic disc of dust and gas rotating around the young Sun.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Starting from the Sun, there are five spheres of rock and ice (we are making an exception by including the Moon in this planetary family because it is a permanent and similarly formed companion of Earth). Next is a terrifying, apparently random section full of rocky debris - the asteroids, a rather chaotic zone partially brought under control by the nearest and most massive planet, Jupiter. We earthly beings, who are today thinking about the next place to call home, have this giant of gas with (presumably) some rock and ice in its interior to that for our existence. Its gravity ensures that the “sky only rarely falls on our heads” and that a bullseye by one of these boulders, which can be up to several hundred kilometers wide, does not bring about our doomsday (which is what the Gauls were terrified of 2000 years ago! And not without reason, as the thousands of circular craters on the Moon and many a hole down here are solid proof that asteroids struck Earth. Just ask T.Rex’s family!). But let’s not talk about the extinction of the dinosaurs; let’s look to the future.</p>",

These worlds are, as Mr. Spock would say, “fascinating.” But unsuitable for life as we know it. They have no atmosphere to provide us with air to breathe. Instead, they have an icy crust much colder than the coldest regions of Siberia in winter.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Under their icy crusts, two of these Moons - known as Europa (how promising!) and Ganymede (thus reminding us of the frivolous instances of the Father of the Gods, Zeus), harbor a massive, deep ocean with - surprise! - warm, mineral-rich water. If anywhere, that is where life would exist, or would have existed. Only very simple life, but at least everything required for life is there - water, volcanic heat, mineral nutrients. Researchers are still scratching their heads about this. Meanwhile, in these depths, it is total pitch black - so it’s not the sort of place that humanity might migrate to - even though we might have seen something of the sort at the cinema in a James Bond film.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The rest of our planetary options can be quickly covered. Beyond Jupiter are another three very big icy worlds of gas. They also bear mythological names from the Greco-Roman pantheon of antiquity. Saturn (who - can you imagine? - ate his child! There are few paintings that exude as much fearsome savagery as Francisco Goya’s grim work in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, which shows this god of prosperity and crops devouring one of his children). Uranus (the primordial ruler of the sky who, for whatever reason, hated his numerous descendants so much that he hid them in the Underworld before Gaia, the Earth Mother, decided to have him castrated with a sickle). And finally Neptune (god of flowing water and the seas - a rather kind old man who at least sported a trident).</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>These three planets most certainly are not a haven for life either. Neither are their Moons, even though the largest of them, Titan, like Earth, has a thick but cold atmosphere, somehow similar to Earth’s. It even rains on this Saturnian Moon, and there are lakes and rivers. What flows in them, however, is not water, but methane and other poisonous substances that are only liquid at these unspeakably cold temperatures. It is too unbearably cold here for oceans and any form of life.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p></p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>To conclude our preliminary expedition on the hunt for a second utopia, we need to make a final loop back and visit the outsider, Pluto, demoted from the category of planet to dwarf planet by “old, white-bearded men.” When we measure its temperature, we can see that it’s not much above absolute zero, the point at which the last molecule and the last atom stop vibrating.

If we don’t let that happen, we will be letting down pioneers like Alexander von Humboldt. Ultimately, all astronauts have been fascinated - even overwhelmed - by the view of Earth from space, by what a fanatically beautiful, inhabited oasis it is in the apparently endless black desert expanse of the cosmos. With all the ingenuity inherent in humanity, is it not an interesting vision to make this planet a bit - no, not a bit, a lot - more worth living on? With the knowledge gained from exploring other planets?</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Home sweet home - planet Earth!

My MIT thesis was titled “Guidance for Manned Orbital Rendezvous,” dedicating that research work to the American astronauts. To write that lengthy treatment of the topic, I drew upon my experience as a fighter pilot and the skills needed to intercept enemy aircraft.

This time, my jet fighter experience and NASA’s growing interesting in mastering space rendezvous influenced them to accept me into the third group of astronauts in October 1963. I was the first astronaut selected with a doctorate and became known to my fellow astronauts as “Dr. Rendezvous.”</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>I am proud to say that my rendezvous and docking ideas were vital to the success of the Gemini and Apollo programs, and they are still used today. My early astronaut years allowed me also to pioneer underwater training techniques, as a substitute for zero gravity flights, to simulate spacewalking. My first space journey was in 1966, as pilot of Gemini 12, with James Lovell as command pilot of the mission. That nearly four-day flight brought to a successful close the stepping stone Gemini program of ten piloted missions. During that flight I was able to establish a new record for spacewalking, spending five and a half hours outside the two-seater Gemini.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But when Gemini 12 splashed down, the unmistakable realization was that we had but a handful of years remaining to achieve Kennedy’s challenge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. There was much work ahead of us. It was inspirational watching a team of 400,000 people working together on a common dream. It was a unified enterprise, a synergy of innovation, effort, and teamwork that was unstoppable - all necessary ingredients to make real a long-held dream of humankind leaning forward to the Moon.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Those early pioneering years were instrumental in shaping my passion today: to help forge our future trajectory in space.

                    "text3" : "<p>There were nearly a billion people all over the Earth who watched and listened as we moonwalked across that magnificent desolation. With Mike Collins circling the Moon in the Columbia command module, we became elite members of the Lonely Hearts Club - we were farther away than any three humans had ever been. Still, we felt connected to home.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>During my hours on the lunar surface, I did gaze back at Earth. IN that solitude, I saw our world as it sat suspended, surrounded by the darkness of space. That blackness is so deep that I could almost reach out and touch it. But then you see planet Earth. It is a soft, glowing presence, bulging from the abyss. It has vividness, aliveness that is not captured in photographs. All of humanity and those I knew and loved resided on that blue sphere.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My stay on the Moon in 1969 filled me with countless other recollections. By the way, while Neil was the first to step on the Moon, I’m the first alien from another world to enter a spacecraft that was going to Earth!</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>But fast forward into the Twenty-First Century and those reminiscences, as dear to me as they are, fall victim to the saying: “That was then, this is now.” Today, I see the Moon in a far different light.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Firstly, America should not re-engage in a second “Moon Race.” That constitutes a dead end, a waste of precious resources. The united States won that contest more than two decades (four and a half decades) ago. What is needed is to lay out what the U.S. involvement at the Moon should be - a plan that refrains from competing but assists every other nation that is planning to land on the lunar surface. That improved plan is to be cooperative with international partners who also want to reach the Moon. In sum, we can afford to be magnanimous. Yes, the United States got there first… but now is the to make it a first step for others.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My vision for the Moon is for both a nearside and far side Lunar Operations Complex. The establishment of this infrastructure would not only tap the resources rich Moon by commercial, private sector groups, but also stimulate international partnerships between nations. America can lead the way in robotic hab/lab building on the Moon by fostering a presence at the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 points, libration gate ports that permit robotic assembly - piece by piece - of hardware and habitation on the Moon. Furthermore, how best to accomplish this on the Moon can be hammered out earlier at a Hawaii-based International Lunar Research Park - essentially trial-running assembly tasks that would be done on the Moon. The high-technology job for the U.S. is developing a Universal Interconnecting device, equipment that enables the coupling of modules and other gear from multiple nations.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>In short, America’s return to the Moon is one that is robotic, to offer infrastructure and leadership. It is one that embraces the talents of China, India, Russia, Japan, Europe, and others, to establish a solid - and this time permanent - foothold on the Moon. Furthermore, in doing so, the U.S. and other nations can sharpen their respective technological skill sets, the know-how that’s mandatory for eventual homesteading of Mars.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Future space travelers will include men and women from all walks of life, taking advantage of trips aboard commercial spaceships. Expectations are high to create a money-making, booming market for tourist-carrying space liners. Initially, vehicles will fly “suborbital” trajectories; then commercial rocket ships will be dedicated to speed tourists into Earth’s orbit. While such voyages are history - making affairs, there’s no leap of faith required. The evolution of flight from the Wright Brothers to today underscores the taming of speed and altitude.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Indeed, it wasn’t until the twentieth century that man took that first powered flight. In 1903, on a windy morning at Kitty Hawk in North Carolina, the Wright Brothers’ Flyer took their maiden voyage, defying gravity. Incidentally, my mother, Marion Moon, was born that same year. And only sixty six years later, Neil and I stepped on the Moon, fulfilling the dreams of million.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The word “tourism” may sound tame. But travel and tourism now form the world’s largest industry, with a gross annual output of several trillion dollars a year. Space tourism is the logical destination for that market.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>What’s more, at this very instant, over 300,000 people are off the Earth. That is, they are in the air and safely seated within aircraft zooming from one destination to another. Anchored in the history of aviation and the advancements ahead, public space travel is in the offing, a progression of technology… and economics. Yes, that means going a little higher, and gaining a bit more speed.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Are there technical challenges ahead in creating the space transportation systems to support space tourism? Yes. In my view, the future resides in reaching orbit less expensively via the development of reusable, two-stage systems capable of airline-type operations. These systems will have high reliability, very quick turn-around, and a large passenger capacity.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Years ago I formed ShareSpace for several reasons: to support public interest in space travel and to educate people of all ages and comes about the possibility - the very real possibility - that they themselves might live this dream.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>I call them “Global Space Travelers,” those that will experience the wonder of space first-hand, while increasing our knowledge of how common people - without years of astronaut training - take to the environment of space. At the same time, it will ignite the market for commercial space vehicles. This enthusiasm, on the part of industry and the public, will inspire the government to set up sensible, forward-looking regulations. The space tourism industry will begin.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>A growing number of citizen space explorers would put backbone into the expression: “If the people lead, the leaders will follow.” It’s not difficult for me to envision various types of vehicles dedicated to space tourism, built by aerospace firms, operated by private firms, and perhaps booked through companies like Wilderness Travel and Club Med!</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Space tourism gives new meaning to “you are free to move about the cabin.” By far the most exhilarating aspect of space travel is the ability to feel your body being liberated from a two-dimensional existence to a 3D existence. Secondly, having face time with Earth is a bonding experience, to get a unique view of our planet. That perspective has been dubbed the “Overview Effect.” Getting an eyeful of Earth from space can affect a person’s attitude about themselves, their planet of origin, and their own place in space and time.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>By lessening the expense of attaining Earth orbit, many new industries are waiting to develop, one of which will be space tourism. Within time, cis-lunar and interplanetary cruise ships will evolve. The upshot is that tens of thousands of citizens will have the opportunity to travel into space, gaining a sense of “participation” in opening the frontier of space to enterprise, exploration, and settlement.</p>",

There are no “giant leaps” this time. More like a hop, skip and a jump strategy. Step by step - just as Mercury and Gemini made Apollo possible - we move deeper into space to land on Phobos, the inner Moon of Mars, all in prelude to sojourns on the Red Planet itself. A Phobos base would be the ideal perch from which to monitor and control the robots that will build the infrastructure on the Martian surface, in preparation for the first human visitors. The techniques and technologies for doing so will be honed at the Moon.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Such bold missions of exploration will require determination, support and political will, as did our mission to the Moon over four-and-a-half decades ago. If we have the vision, we can reach a diversity of destinations, including asteroids, on the pathway to Mars.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>My USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) calls for essential basics, such as an Exploration Module imbued with radiation shielding, food-production, and recycling facilities needed for spaceflight of up to three years. The International Space Station, which was completed in 1981, is the ideal test bed for showcasing these capabilities, as well as for evaluating rigid and inflatable structures useful for the outward movement of crew into deep space. We must use our station savvy to prototype specialized safe-haven, interplanetary, and taxi modules, hardware that can be combined with NASA Orion-type crew vehicles.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>By way of reusable spacecraft that I call “Cyclers” traffic routes between Earth and the Moon, Mars and Earth can be put in motion. Very much like ocean liners, the Cycler system would perpetually glide along predictable pathways, moving people, equipment, and other materials to and from the Earth over inner-Solar System mileage.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Looking towards 2046, the Earth, the Moon, and Mars will form a celestial triad of worlds - busy hubs for the ebb and flow of passengers, cargo and commerce traversing the inner-Solar System. The common, sustainable like that ties humanity’s space future together is reusability - a progressive set of reusable boosters, reusable access to space, and reusable interplanetary cyclers.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>Humankind is at an inflection moment in history, a chance to test the next generation of space adventures to reach out into deep space and start moving along the pathway to homesteading the Red Planet and becoming a multi-planet species.</p><div class='sidepanel-spacer-m'></div><p>The challenge ahead is not only daunting, it is monumental and historic.
