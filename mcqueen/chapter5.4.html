		Savile Row and the energy of the primal. The painstakingly cut and sewn silk lining of the jacket belies the superficial crudeness of the skin’s assemblage, depicting a moment of becoming between the natural and the modern globalized world.

	<p class="paragraph">
		The relationship between civilisation and the primordial power of nature is explored further in Irere, a collection inspired by the Roland Joffe film The Mission in which a Jesuit missionary in 18th century South America attempts to protect a native tribe from Portuguese forces. Taking its title from an indigenous Amazonian word for transformation, Irere was presented in three sequences. First, models walked out as pirates who had survived a shipwreck, the fragility of their femininity conveyed in the ‘Oyster’ gown constructed from boned tulle and shredded chiffon. This was followed by another torn chiffon dress – a hint that the girl had survived and was to be transformed by mischievous spirits she would encounter in the forest, represented by a series of designs in black, worn by masked models. For the finale, darkness gave way to a riot of colour, as models emerged as birds of paradise in bold printed chiffon gowns, and thus the cycle of transformation was complete – the power of the natural world had transcended the man made.

		I try to push the silhouette. To change the silhouette is to change the thinking of how we look. What I do is look at ancient African tribes, and the way they dress. The rituals of how they dress. There’s a lot of tribalism in the collections.
