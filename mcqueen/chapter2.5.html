		It was an art thing, to change the way women looked, just by cut, to make a longer torso. But I was taking it to an extreme. The girls looked quite menacing, because there was so much top and so little bottom, because of the length of the legs.

		<small>AT THIS TIME</small> of his life, Lee was living in a council flat in Tooting, South London, and claiming social security benefits. Though money was scarce, it would only fuel the designer’s ingenuity when working with
		fabrics like the linings of the curtains
		in his flat, or latex from a local builder’s supplier. A black glitter bodice from his sophomore collection, Nihilism – the origins of McQueen’s signature corset – was in fact the result of a “happy accident”, when a bucket of latex was kicked over and took the form of the storm drain the liquid had moulded itself to. The ‘road kill’ prints in The Birds (Spring/Summer 1995), his Hitchcock-inspired third collection, were made by rolling a car tyre covered in Indian ink over the clothes. In these free wheeling early years, the key elements of McQueen’s signature silhouette had begun to take shape, and the character of the Alexander McQueen woman was emerging. “Like her creator, she was at once fragile and fierce, ethereal and street-wise,” as Susannah Frankel eloquently describes her.
