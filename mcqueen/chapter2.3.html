		<small>GROWING UP</small> in London’s East End, Lee Alexander McQueen’s interests were quite different from his classmates at the all-boys comprehensive, Rokeby. “I was literally three years old when I started drawing”, he told the writer Susannah Frankel. “I always wanted to be a designer. I read books on fashion from the age of twelve. I followed designers’ careers. I knew Giorgio Armani was a window dresser, and Emmanuel Ungaro was a tailor.” And when he left school in 1985 at the age of 16, after encouragement from his mother, McQueen began an apprenticeship on Savile Row at Anderson & Sheppard, tailors by appointment to the British royal family.
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph paragraph2-3">
		After two years at Anderson & Sheppard, McQueen moved a few doors down “the Row” to Gieves & Hawkes, where he worked on military tailoring. He stayed for just over a year before taking up a post at the theatrical costumers Angels, cutting clothes for West End shows such as Les Miserables. In the space of four years, the designer had mastered the intricacies of bespoke tailoring, which would inform the basis for much of his work, and the codes of 19th century costume, which would later become a signature of his own designs. Now it was time to shift his attention to contemporary fashion design: in 1989 McQueen went to work for the London-based Japanese designer Koji Tatsuno, and the following year, for Romeo Gigli in Milan. It was
		these credentials that afforded him a place on the feted postgraduate fashion design course at London’s Central Saint Martins. “He was technically brilliant, even though he’d never actually studied design”, noted Bobby Hilson, the course’s founder.
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		McQueen graduated from Central Saint Martins in 1992 with Jack the Ripper Stalks his Victims (Autumn/Winter 1992), a “day into eveningwear collection inspired by 19th century streetwalkers”. The collection caught the attention of Isabella Blow, the famously eccentric stylist who would become his close friend and a muse. Not much remains of McQueen’s early work, especially his first collection after graduating, Taxi Driver (Autumn/Winter 1993), which McQueen packed into black bin bags for a meeting, only to lose outside a bar in Soho. Yet those who attended Taxi Driver’s presentation at The Ritz, remember black crow feathers, intricate jet beading, latex and a print of Travis Bicker, the anti-hero of Martin Scorcese’s film of the same name. The infamous ‘bumster’ trouser was first shown on the catwalk in Nihilism (Spring/Summer 1994). Cut daringly low on the hip to “accentuate parts of the woman’s anatomy to create a new shape”, they became an integral part of the sharp tailoring that would go on to characterise his work.
