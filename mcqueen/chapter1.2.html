		<small>LEE ALEXANDER MCQUEEN</small> was one of the most visionary designers of his generation. Having left school at the age of 16 to undertake an apprenticeship on Londonâ€™s Savile Row, McQueen assisted the designers Koji Tatsuno and Romeo Gigli before graduating with a Masters degree in Fashion Design from Central Saint Martins in 1992. In the following years, McQueen gained the attention and respect of the fashion industry for the emotional power and raw energy of his presentations, and the romantic, but determinedly contemporary nature of his collections. He was appointed Chief Designer at Givenchy in 1996, a move which allowed him to combine his knowledge of bespoke British tailoring with the intricacies of traditional haute couture techniques. In 2000, the Gucci Croup acquired 51% of Alexander McQueen, where he remained Creative Director. Over the course of a 20-year career, McQueen received a number of awards, and in 2003, was appointed a Commander of the British Empire by the Queen. His imagination and unique approach to design have left an indelible imprint on the fashion world, and a legacy that continues to this day.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">
		As a designer, Lee Alexander McQueen sought to imbue garments with a visceral, emotional intensity through merging the personal with the political, the organic with the modern, and the rigours of traditional tailoring techniques with the lightness of haute couture. As such, the world of Alexander McQueen is one defined by how the elements of fragility and strength, tradition and technology, severity and grace, contrast and complement each other to create a new vision for fashion in the 21st century. The Relationship between Man and Machineis a showcase of the key themes and concepts that inspired and informed Alexander McQueen throughout his career: Romanticism, the Gothic, history, nature, anatomy, and the interplay between each in his search for
		the sublime.
