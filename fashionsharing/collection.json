Titled \"COSMIC WORKSHOP,\" the women’s ready-to-wear collection joined 032c’s ’90s rave wear-inspired menswear apparel line. The show cemented 032c’s pivot from magazine and occasional apparel designer into fully fledged designer label, one that translates the visual language of its Berlin roots for a global fashion audience using sheer fabrics and a palette of black, gray, white, and metallics.",

Having previously attained success without advertising campaigns or shows, this move positioned the label in a new context. There is also a new name to boot: 1017 ALYX 9SM – referencing Williams’ birth date and an abbreviation of the label’s first studio on Saint Mark’s Place in New York.",

			"description" : "The voices of women deserve a far bigger hearing in fashion, as in life. Sarah Burton holds that feeling to heart in a way that strives to connect deep history with the present. This collection was, she said, \"about sisterhood, about women’s milestones and rituals: birth, christenings, weddings, funerals. It’s about being strong and emotional, but also saying it’s okay to show your vulnerability.\" The connections between the team’s immersion in pagan, Christian, and natural history and the makings of the clothes might not be immediately visible to the naked eye, but the finesse and power was.",

If Balenciaga’s Fall Winter 2018 collection was a message for us to keep hope alive in an increasingly turbulent world, the Spring Summer 2019 collection was all about letting the world burn — but looking great while it does. For this collection, Demna Gvasalia collaborated with artist Jon Rafman to create an LED tunnel that encased the runway. It lit up, throughout the course of the show, in flames, like the inside of a vein, like tv static—a visual manifestation of the chaotic mental overload of today’s generation.",

			"description" : "The Calvin Klein show began just like a movie. The red lights that greeted the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Jeff Goldblum, and the Houston Rockets’s James Harden on arrival faded to black, and three walls of the ground floor space of 205 West 39th Street crackled to life with an early scene from Jaws, the one where poor Chrissie Watkins goes swimming and doesn’t come out of the water. Film has been a touchstone for Raf Simons since he landed here two years ago. This time he did a deep dive, choosing Steven Spielberg’s 1975 man vs. nature masterpiece (and Hollywood’s first blockbuster), and the Mike Nichols classic of post-adolescent indecision, The Graduate, as reference points.",

What resulted was GmbH’s finest collection to date. The line now features a dedicated womenswear branch, which was new this season, and actually dominated the runway in terms of looks.",

Familiar HP tropes such as utility belts, vests, work shirts and chore jackets were styled with boldly colored sportswear, metallic leather coats, denim and bottoms featuring satellite images of Australian terrain. Italicized Cantonese characters replaced Preston’s signature Cyrillic Style logo. Furthermore, the collection marked a debut collaboration with Nike Vision, featuring a series of speed racer shades with four interchangeable accessory lenses in reflective grey, orange grey, yellow and dark grey.",

John Elliott has a personal approach to design that is immediately apparent upon viewing the new range, with worn-in accents reflecting the designer’s intent to create comfortable clothing for daily life. The new collection showcased more collaborative Suicoke sandals and new jewelry designed in collaboration with Japanese brand Mars.

Though the line offers a post Soviet vision, one that isn’t entirely dissimilar to Vetements or Gosha Rubinsky, Maczek’s take is distinct in its ability to evade the familiar, to still feel fresh and new despite being inspired by age old traditions.",

Flowing gowns and trim blazers were subverted by track-ready body suits and Nike T-shirts, emphasizing sportswear’s continuing influence upon Virgil Abloh‘s designs. Accompanying the sportswear-leaning looks were a host of gargantuan gowns and feminine tulle skirts, appropriately crafted with mesh panels or juxtaposed with tucked-in Off-White & Nike tees, subverting the feminine lean.",

And this surfer dude came down. Super-crusty, kinda-like dreads—yeah, totally feral—a bogan surfer. He put his board down and had this tribal pattern on the top of the surfboard and I was like . . . that’s just fucking awesome! I sneaked a picture, and that became the beginning of the print. Then hanging out where my brother had just moved, just next to Perth, it was the best holiday I’ve ever had. But everyone there was trapped in a time: Australiana, going from ’70s into ’80s. Everything came from that moment.\"",

In this case, cheery models at the entrance of his Spring 2019 show—the big finale of New York Fashion Week: Men’s this season—were passing out Threes Brewing’s Vliet in wave blue cans with neon orange Snyder-branded koozies. More than just getting everyone giddy, the beer served to set the scene for vacation vibes. Snyder looked to his grandfather’s closet for inspiration again this season, taking the tentpoles of retro resort dressing—leisure suits, Hawaiian shirts, and knit polos—and infusing them with a modern loucheness.",

So props to Donatella Versace for taking a long, hard look at various masculine archetypes and attempting to skew the lens a little.
