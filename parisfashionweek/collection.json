			"description" : "For his Alyx Spring 2020 collection, Matthew Williams delivers once again a successful collection consisting of sustainable, functionally-driven clothing reminiscent of military clothing. In this presentation, Williams also included forms of tailoring, in a formal urban form. While creating this formal wear, the designer always draws inspiration from military clothing, making it a key feature in his collections. High-tech layering pieces co-mingle with Williamsâ€™ famed rollercoaster buckle. He also again offers a collaboration in footwear with Nike.",
